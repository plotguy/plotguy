AxiDraw CLI and Python API — Installation

Supported on python 2.7, python 3.6, 
Mac, Windows, and Linux.


—————————————————————————————————————————

* Prerequisite (1 of 2): Python

If you are on Windows, you'll probably not already have this on your computer. 
Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/

If you have a choice, we highly recommend installing python 3.6 or newer. :)


* Prerequisite (2 of 2): lxml

If you think that you might already have this installed on your computer, you can skip ahead to “Getting started” below— it won’t hurt to try.



Recommended procedures for installing lxml:

(A) Mac Users:

From the terminal, enter these three lines, providing password when requested:
sudo easy_install pip
xcode-select --install
sudo -H pip install lxml


Additional help for lxml installation is available here:
http://lxml.de/installation.html


(B) Windows Users:

Install PIP on your computer, following the instructors here:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

You may need to open your command prompt with a right-click and "Run as administrator" in order to avoid permissions errors.

It is best if possible to start with precompiled binaries for your particular version of Windows and Python.

Download the appropriate "WHL" file for your version of
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml

* For a typical modern Windows 10 computer running python 2.7, the download might be something similar to: lxml‑3.7.3‑cp27‑cp27m‑win_amd64.whl

* For a typical modern Windows 10 computer running python 3.6, the download might be something similar to: lxml‑3.7.3‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl


Once you have this "whl" package downloaded, you can install it with:
python -m pip install some-package.whl

(As before, you may need to run your command prompt as administrator.)


[An alternate (less-recommended) method for installing with Windows is to try:
  python -m pip install lxml

However, you may also get an error that requires you to download and install
Visual C++, for example from aka.ms/vcpython27 and so forth.]


Additional help for lxml installation is available here:
http://lxml.de/installation.html



(C) Linux Users

 Install PIP on your computer, following the instructors here:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

Then, use:
  pip install lxml



Additional help for lxml installation is available here:

Getting started:

Unzip the archive
cd to the folder:

cd /Users/username/Documents/axidraw-api/  (Your location and path will vary)


(I) Test that the software is operational:

A (very simple) sample file is included. You can plot it with the
following command line:

python axicli.py AxiDraw_trivial.svg 

If everything is set up correctly, this should plot the SVG file, which contains a single object. If you do not have lxml installed, you will get the following error: “The fantastic lxml wrapper for libxml2 is required [...]”

(II) Getting started with the command-line interface: 
You can get additional documentation and command-line usage options by using 
    python axicli.py --help
or refer to the full documentation, at: https://axidraw.com/doc/cli_api/

(III) Getting started with the python API:
Two example python scripts are included. See README.txt for instructions.
For the full python API documentation, please see: https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/
